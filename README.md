# gtk4-test-3
Learning how to write a GUI program using GTK4 - First GUI from scratch,
iteration #3

Goals for this iteration:

- Spawn a new window with a data display label and a button, using the bottom
button of the main window.

  done

- Put the timebase code in a file called control.c.

  done

- Create a new file called gui.c to give main.c access to interfaces for both
windows and start main window, and run initialization code for window widgets

  done, but cancelled subwindow interface. Not wasting my time. Time is my most
  precious resource.

- IDK.. maybe a menu bar with a Help > About

  ..Not going to waste my time. Cancelled. Will learn this as I go with my real
  project.

After this iteration, I think I should have all the knowledge I need to
complete the project for which was the reason I started gtk4-test.
