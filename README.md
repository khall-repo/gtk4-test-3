# gtk4-test-3
Learning how to write a GUI program using GTK4 - First GUI from scratch,
iteration #3

Goals for this iteration:

- Spawn a new window with a data display label and a button, using the bottom
button of the main window.

  in progress

- Put the timebase code in a file called control.c.

  done

- Play around with using a new file called gui.c to give main.c access to
interfaces for both windows and start main window, and run initialization
code for window widgets

  not started

- IDK.. maybe a menu bar with a Help > About?

  not started

After this iteration, I think I should have all the knowledge I need to
complete the project for which was the reason I started gtk4-test.
